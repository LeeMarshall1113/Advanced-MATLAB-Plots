Advanced MATLAB Plots

A demonstration script showcasing various MATLAB plotting features, including:

    Tiled Layout with subplots (line plots, error bars, stacked bar charts, dual y-axes, scatter plots).
    3D surface visualization with contour overlays.
    Polar plots with custom radial ticks.
    Annotations, legends, error bars, and colorbars.

Overview

The script is separated into sections:

    Data Generation
    Creates synthetic data for:
        A sine wave with noise and a random “error” vector (for error bars).
        Random integer data for stacked bar plots.
        A set of points showing a linear correlation (for scatter and regression).
        A 2D grid for a 3D surface (Z = sin(R)/R) plus polar plot data.

    Tiled Layout (4 Subplots)
    Demonstrates how to arrange plots in a 2×2 grid.
        Line Plot with Error Bars
        Stacked Bar Chart
        Dual Y-Axis on the same axes (yyaxis)
        Scatter Plot + Regression Fit

    3D Surface + Contour
    Displays a 3D surface (surf) of a radial function, overlays contour lines (contour3), applies smoothing (shading interp), and adds a colorbar.

    Polar Plot
    Demonstrates a polar coordinate visualization with custom radial ticks and simple text annotation.

Getting Started

    Requirements:
        MATLAB R2016b (or later) for the tiledlayout functionality (introduced in R2019b, but older versions can adapt using subplot).
        Basic familiarity with MATLAB plotting functions.

    Installation:
        Clone or download this repository.
        Open advanced_matlab_plots.m in MATLAB.

    Running the Script:
        Run the entire script (F5 in MATLAB or right-click and select Run).
        Each section produces one or more figures:
            A figure titled “Tiled Layout Demo” with 4 subplots.
            A separate figure for 3D surface + contour.
            A final figure for the polar plot.

    File Structure:
        advanced_matlab_plots.m: Main MATLAB script containing all code.
        README.md: This file (an example README).

Script Breakdown

Below is a high-level breakdown of each major portion of the code:

    Section 1: Generate Synthetic Data
        t, trueSignal, measuredSignal: A sine wave with noise.
        errorVals: Random error estimates for errorbar.
        cat1, cat2, cat3: Random integer data for stacked bars.
        (X3, Y3), Z3: Meshgrid for 3D surface.
        (theta, r): Angular and radial data for the polar plot.

    Section 2: Tiled Layout with 4 Plots
        2A. Error Bars + True Signal: errorbar(t, measuredSignal, ...) plus a reference line.
        2B. Stacked Bar Chart: bar(..., 'stacked') with group labels.
        2C. Dual Y-Axis: yyaxis left and yyaxis right.
        2D. Scatter Plot + Regression: Plots data points, fits a line (polyfit, polyval), and overlays it.

    Section 3: 3D Surface with Contour
        surf(X3, Y3, Z3) creates the surface.
        contour3(X3, Y3, Z3, 20, 'k') overlays 20 contour lines in black.
        shading interp, colormap, and colorbar style the surface and add a legend for magnitude.

    Section 4: Polar Plot
        polarplot(theta, r) draws the radial function.
        thetalim, rticks adjust axis limits.
        text(...) annotates a local maximum on the plot.

Customization

    Colormaps: Switch out colormap parula with jet, hot, etc.
    Layouts: Replace tiledlayout with multiple calls to subplot if you have an older MATLAB version.
    Data: Integrate your own datasets to replace the synthetic data for more realistic plots.
    Annotations: Add or remove text, arrows, and labels to highlight important data points or regions.
